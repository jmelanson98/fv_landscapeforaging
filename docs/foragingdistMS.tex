\section{Introduction}
\section{Methods}

\subsection{Study system}
Our study took place in the Lower Fraser Valley in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, in an agricultural system dominated by mixed vegetable, hay, and perennial berry production. From 1984-2018 the Lower Fraser Valley underwent a 13\% decrease in forest patch area, mainly resulting from conversion to urban or agricultural land use \parencite{paulTrackingChangesSoil2020a}. .... \emph{decide what else needs to be said in this section later on!}

Field surveys were conducted across six replicate landscapes distributed throughout the Lower Fraser Valley. Each landscape encompassed roughly 3 sq km of farmland interspersed with rural/suburban residence. Landscapes were initially chosen to span a gradient of configurational and composition diversity metrics, including Shannon's diversity, edge density, and the ratio of annual to perennial crop cultivation. 

Thirty sampling transects (50 meters x 2 meters) were established in each landscape, spaced as evenly as possible based on land-access and the availability of foraging resources on which to observe bees. We did not survey in active crop fields except for high-bush blueberry, which offers floral resources during its spring bloom and can sometimes host other flowers such as clovers (\textit{Trifolium spp.}) and flatweed (\textit{Hypochaeris radicata}) later in the season. A total of \emph{INSERT TOTAL TRANSECT NUMBER HERE} were surveyed over the course of two years (2022-2023) due to changes in land access within and between years. 

\subsection{\textit{Bombus} collections and floral surveys}
Each landscape was surveyed during 10 sampling rounds in year one (May-August 2022) and 17 sampling rounds in year two (March-August 2023). During each round of sampling, surveys were conducted on \emph{INSERT MEAN PLUS OR MINUS SD OF SAMPLING EFFORT} (mean $\pm$ SE) transects. 

\textit{Bombus} surveys at each transect entailed 5 minutes of active search time (totaling 140 hours in 2022 and \emph{INSERT TOTAL SAMPLING EFFORT 2023} in 2023), during which the stopwatch was paused whenever a foraging bumble bee was sighted. Specimens were captured by netting, placed into sterile 15 mL tubes, and immediately placed on ice before transfer to a -80\degree C freezer at the end of the day.  Surveys were conducted on days when the temperature was above 12\degree C (10\degree C for queen surveys) and wind speeds below 2.5 m/s. In 2022, all \textit{Bombus} species were collected; in 2023 only the focal species (\textit{B. mixtus} and \textit{B. impatiens} were collected.

To assess floral quality, all flowering plants within the transect area were identified to species or genus level. Abundance estimates were given for each species using a log-scale (i.e., 0 = 1-10 inflorescences, 1 = 11-100 inflorescences, 2 = 101-1000 inflorescences, 3 = 1001-10,000 inflorescences,  4 = 10,000+ inflorescences). Floral survey data was later filtered to exclude species which bumble bees were never observed visiting (based on over ~3,400 visitation events in 2022, and ~3,500 visitation events in 2023). This filtering step was included to reduce the noise introduced by a variety of herbaceous weeds with flowers too small to attract or support bumble bee foragers, but which were frequently observed on the transects in high abundance. 


\subsection{Landscape characterization}
Land cover maps were developed for each study site based on manual classification of Google Earth satellite imagery (2021) and site visits. Briefly, land cover was classified into 16 categories: annual row crops, blueberry, cranberry, other perennials, polyculture, hay meadows, pasture, fallow, grassy field margins, hedgerows (tree-dominated), hedgerows (blackberry-dominated), forest, wetlands, urban/suburban, roads, and water). These land cover types were chosen based on their hypothesized provisioning of nesting/floral resources and differences in disturbance regimes (see Table \ref{tab:landscapetable} for details). Land cover was mapped at 2-meter resolution in QGIS \parencite{QGIS_software}. 

%Landscape Shannon diversity, the proportion of each landscape in blueberry cultivation, and the proportion of each landscape consisting of edge habitat (grassy field margins and hedgerows) were calculated within a 500-meter buffer surrounding each transect using the package \textit{lsm} \parencite{lsm-package}. Here, "edge density" is defined as the proportion of area within each buffer zone that was classified as a hedgerow or grassy margin. A buffer size was 500m was chosen based on the average foraging distance observed for bumble bee species across many studies \parencite{molaReview2025}; we used average foraging distance (as opposed to maximum foraging distance) as it represents the area accessible to the majority of individuals surveyed at a location, including those from species with smaller foraging ranges.
