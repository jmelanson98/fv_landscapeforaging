\section{Abstract}

For central-place foragers like bumblebees, spatial proximity of nesting and floral resources is key for supporting colony growth and reproduction. Agricultural landscape simplification may favour species adapted to profit from patchy but abundant flowers, or those with broad nesting habitat niches; these traits may even explain species invasions or range expansions. We previously showed that native bumblebee abundance declines in response to landscape simplification, while that of an invasive species (\emph{Bombus impatiens}) does not. We now aim to identify the behavioural underpinnings of these patterns. We performed queen nest searching-surveys, quantified colony densities, and fit spatially-explicit models of foraging distance (including the effects of floral abundance on patch visitation) for two bumblebee species (\textit{B. mixtus} and \textit{B. impatiens}).  Our work will provide insights regarding pollinator movement and habitat use in anthropogenically disturbed landscapes, while also deepening our understanding of how these systems may influence species invasions.
