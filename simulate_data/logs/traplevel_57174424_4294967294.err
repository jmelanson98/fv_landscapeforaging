Chain 4 Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Chain 4 Exception: Exception: poisson_log_lpmf: Log rate parameter is -nan, but must be not nan! (in '/tmp/RtmppjCbof/model-2ce2e57c550dca.stan', line 29, column 6 to column 49) (in '/tmp/RtmppjCbof/model-2ce2e57c550dca.stan', line 101, column 0 to line 104, column 39)
Chain 4 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
Chain 4 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
Chain 4 
Warning message:
Dropping 'draws_df' class as required metadata was removed.
